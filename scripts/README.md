# Near Testnet Faucet - SCRIPTS

The folder contains bash scripts to  build/deploy and interact with the faucet contract. They are not necessary for the working of the contract or frontend app. However they are required for the NCD submission. These scripts are meant to be ran from the parent `./near-testnet-faucet` directory.

Since developed on OSX, your mileage on other Systems may vary. If you plan to run them on Windows machine one thing you will certainly need is to to escape the `"` characters in the with `\` eg. `\"argument\": \"value\"`

I've made my best to explain each line of the scripts as to add little bit of educational value as well as keeping them for future reference.
